🚀 About Me
------------------------
🎓 I am Krunal Shah, a software developer (specializing in Laravel/React Applications) and a Freelancer. I have completed my masters in computer application and after that I have been working in software industry. 


👨‍💻 I have worked in various domains and enjoy coding and learning about the business. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2021 I focused over cloud services and cleared Oracle certification for cloud developer and architect.
